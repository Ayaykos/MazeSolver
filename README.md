# MazeSolver
Currently in the making, nearly complete.

Analyzes an image of a perfect/simply-connected square maze and outputs a new image with a path-finding line that shows the solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation that is still being worked on:

	-Process for analyzing split path going opposite directions
	-Fixing excess draw paths
