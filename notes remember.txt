remember to change:
	checkHor/checkVert
		for loops go farther than they should, issue will arise with differing pathwidths in mazes
		actually may be an issue with for loop not detecting that its reached the exit path 

	lol nvm forgot to uncomment nextDir = 5 at end of sequence if boundary reached

potential issue check later:
	rightDivUp 
	changed x += halfspace to x += (halfspace + (halfspace/3))
	also rightDivDown had x += halfspace + (halfspace/3) but changed to x += (halfspace + (halfspace/3))
