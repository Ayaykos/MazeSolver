remember to change:
	checkHor/checkVert
		for loops go farther than they should, issue will arise with differing pathwidths in mazes
		actually may be an issue with for loop not detecting that its reached the exit path 

	lol nvm forgot to uncomment nextDir = 5 at end of sequence if boundary reached

potential issue check later:
	rightDivUp 
	changed x += halfspace to x += (halfspace + (halfspace/3))
	also rightDivDown had x += halfspace + (halfspace/3) but changed to x += (halfspace + (halfspace/3))


divFunctions - 10:30
split path function - 12:00
	-dinner
only draw correct path - 2 hrs


potential issue check later:
	-paths not drawing exactly through middle
potential issue check later:
	-dead ends being too close to boundary, treated as exit path
		-maybe at start in checkEntry also create checkExit and if found exit path doesn't match then scratch it
